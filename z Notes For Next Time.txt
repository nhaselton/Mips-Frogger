	MARS LIMIATIONS
1) Look into bigger bitmap strats like allocating my own memory, (no clue if its possible)
2) fix long hold glitch,coudl be bitmap related not sure
3) find a way to double buffer
	BUGS
1) drawing sprite arrays are all kinds of broken, full of little hacks hoping it doesnt break

	BETTER DESIGN
1) start of every frame erase all sprites, end of every frame draw all sprites
2) Max grid (AFAIK) is 64x64, woudl make sense to do an array for all map spots rather than pixel math
3) for static background could do giant 64x64 image and every time someone moves you jsut get the old image background in EraseSprite
4) Keep s registers consistent between functions, why are logs and cars so different when functions are fairly similar
5) look into more than 4 args for a fucntion, maybe just use the t regs (probably bad to use S ones but who knows)
